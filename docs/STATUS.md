# Status

Updated at the end of each phase.

## Phase 0 — Architecture — ✅ in progress → done when skeleton installs
- Implemented: monorepo skeleton, root config (pnpm/turbo/tsconfig), CLAUDE.md, README,
  core docs (VISION, ARCHITECTURE, RUNTIME_LOOP, UI_PROTOCOL, MORPH_ENGINE), ADRs 0001–0003,
  `.env.example`, docker-compose.
- Remaining: fill remaining docs as their phases land.
- Known limitations: docs describe the target; later phases implement them.
- Next: Phase 1 — UI Matter.

## Phase 1 — UI Matter — ✅ done
- Implemented:
  - `@dm/ui-protocol`: blueprint/patch validation + tree helpers (find, collect, unique-ids).
  - `@dm/morph-engine`: pure `applyPatch` with inverse generation, `MorphGuard`
    (confidence gates, cooldown, major-dwell, focus protection, unsaved-state protection,
    critical bypass), `computeDiff`, and `MorphHistory` (undo).
  - `apps/web` (Next.js 15 / React 19): schema-driven `Render`er over the approved registry,
    a Simulation Lab, AI presence indicator, Inspector ("why did the UI change?"), Undo,
    and dark/light theming.
  - Phase-1 deterministic `decide()` (no LLM) wiring event → decision → guard → morph.
- Tested: 27 unit + integration tests pass; web builds and prerenders; headless loop test
  proves incident→recover→undo with the editor never destroyed.
- Known limitations: `decide()` is a stand-in for the Phase 3/4 significance + decision
  engines; events are UI-simulated (no event store / WebSocket yet); morph timing uses the
  wall clock in the app shell (pure engine stays clock-free).
- Next: Phase 2 — Perception (event contract already in `contracts`; add event store,
  world model, simulator source, WebSocket in `apps/runtime`).
